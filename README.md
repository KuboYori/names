I'm currently trying to figure out my new name. If you want to help me in the process, feel free to just call me any of the names in the list. This is completely optional, you are not required to actually do it. I am looking for my actual name. This will not have an effect on my online presence.

(I know the way I'm sharing this list might seem a bit pathetic. I just can't be bothered to put much effort into it, as long as it gets the job done. If any issues arise, feel free to DM me on Discord.)

Here is the list of names that I am currently considering to use:


-Valentina

-Violet

-Sophia / Sofia

-Victoria
