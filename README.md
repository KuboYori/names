I'm currently trying to figure out my new name. If you want to help me in the process, feel free to just call me any of the names in the list.

This is completely optional, you are not required to actually do it.

(I know that the way I am sharing this list is a bit pathetic. I just can't be bothered to put some actual effort into this as long as it gets the job done)

Here is the list of names that I am currently considering to use:
(Thay are on no particular order.)

Valentina

Violet

Sophia / Sofia

Victoria
